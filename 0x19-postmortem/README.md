# 🚨 **Postmortem: The Great API Service Apocalypse – August 5, 2023** 🧨

## Issue Summary:

- **Duration**: 08:00 AM - 09:30 AM (UTC)
- **Impact**: 70% of our lovely users were left twiddling their thumbs, unable to use the API. Form submissions failed, projects wouldn’t load, and admin dashboards were about as useful as a screen door on a submarine.
- **Root Cause**: A hungry memory leak gobbled up all the server’s resources, leaving it unresponsive and cranky. 😤

## Timeline:

Here's a dramatic play-by-play of our little saga:

- **07:50 AM**: 🧐 Monitoring tools noticed something fishy. API response times spiked, but we thought, "Nah, it'll be fine."
- **08:00 AM**: 🚨 *ALERT ALERT!* The API is down. 70% of users are stranded. Panic ensues.
- **08:05 AM**: 👀 Initial thoughts: "Maybe Cloudinary’s down? Blame the cloud!"
- **08:20 AM**: ☁️ *Cloudinary’s fine.* *Sighs* Time to check our servers.
- **08:30 AM**: 💻 *Ah, there’s the culprit.* Our Node.js server was hoarding memory like a squirrel hoards nuts.
- **08:40 AM**: 🚀 The infrastructure team was called in. They brought their trusty wrenches and… well, restarted the server.
- **09:00 AM**: 🧠 The actual problem was identified—memory was leaking all over the place thanks to improper handling of large image uploads.
- **09:10 AM**: 🧹 Temporary fix: A good ol’ restart.
- **09:30 AM**: 🎉 Full service restored. Crisis averted!

## Root Cause and Resolution:

The problem? Our Node.js server was trying to handle big ol’ image files by loading them entirely into memory—because, of course, that’s a good idea, right? 😅 This led to a *memory leak*, making the server fold under pressure like a deck chair at a sumo wrestling contest.

**How we fixed it**:
- **Step 1**: Gave the server a nap (restarted it).
- **Step 2**: Refactored our image upload process to handle file streaming like a pro. No more hoarding memory!

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

**Let’s avoid another apocalypse. Here’s what we’ll do:**
1. **Memory Limits**: Set up hard caps for memory usage—no more overindulgence.
2. **File Streaming**: We now handle image uploads like professionals, not amateurs.
3. **More Monitoring**: Add more eyes (monitoring tools) on the memory. Keep them sharp and alert.
4. **API Audit**: Sweep through all our endpoints for any similar memory-hogging culprits.
5. **Stress Testing**: Simulate a flood of traffic and image uploads, just to make sure everything can hold together under pressure.

### TODO:
- [ ] Patch the Node.js server.
- [ ] Implement file streaming.
- [ ] Add detailed memory monitoring.
- [ ] Audit API endpoints for optimization.
- [ ] Add stress testing to our CI/CD pipeline.

*Remember kids, if you’re going to let your server manage image uploads, make sure it doesn’t act like a memory hoarder. Until next time, happy debugging!*
